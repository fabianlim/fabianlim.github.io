# Guthub Resume In Markdown

This is my resume hosted at https://fabianlim.github.io.

It is created in Markdown, inspired by:
- https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume: stylesheet and idea taken from here, but this is based on [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) which has not had support since 2022.
- https://smallsharpsoftwaretools.com/tutorials/pandoc_resume/: got the idea to change to [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/).
